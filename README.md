# A 5 number and 5 letter handwritten digit classifer created for CSC3995 Machine Learning
- Goal: to Implement project and practice machine learning techniques from CSC3995 - Machine Learning
- Taking Juypter notebook and turning it into a built out application

## TO-DO
- [ ] Add documentation
  - [x] Add Requirements
  - [ ] Add documentation for submodules 
    - [ ] Example
    - [x] Model
    - [ ] Model_metrics
    - [ ] Pipelines
    - [ ] Preprocess
    - [ ] Tests
- [ ] Add unit testing
  -  In progress!
- [x] Add validation to pipeline
- [ ] Refactor for model and pipeline to be objects not functions?
  -  [ ] Pipeline objecting using builder pattern
- [ ] Create a way for pretrained model to get novel predictions 

## Style notes
- Snake case is used for function and variable names

## Source Control Notes
- Current version in examples/demo.py is working
- All new developments will be made in dev branch
